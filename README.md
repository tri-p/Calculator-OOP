# Calculator-OOP
A simple calculator program created in Python that allows the user to input two numbers; the calculator then evaluates the value and displays the result for the user.

### To run the program
1. Open the file.
2. Run the Python code 'calculator_program.py'.
3. It will ask the user to choose an operation.
4. It will then prompt the user to input two numbers.
5. It will evaluate the input and display the result.
6. It will show errors if the input is invalid.
7. The program will ask if the user would like to try again.
8. If the user types "y", the user can choose another operation to use again.
9. If the user types "n", it displays a 'thank you' message and closes the program.
